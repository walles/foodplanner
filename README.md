Example:
    ./foodplanner.rb examples/menu.yaml examples/calendar.yaml

# TODO

* Accept a previously generated menu as input and avoid those courses
for this menu.

* Add support for expressing things like "we want sausage at most once
per generated menu". Needs tagging of food courses, and some way of
putting constraints on different tags.

* Add support for expressing things like "we want vegetarian at least
once per generated menu". Needs tagging of food courses, and some way
of putting constraints on different tags.
